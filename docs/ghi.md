## User Homepage

The User Homepage is the first thing that authenticated users access upon
logging in. There, they are welcomed with their name and have the option
to choose between looking for activity recommendations, viewing their previously favorited activities, or creating a new activity that they can publish to the database.

## Survey Filter and Activity Recommendations Page

The Survey Filter and Activity Recommendations page allows a user to filter recommended activities based off of threw filter options: *participants*, *environment*, and *category*. After submitting their filtered preferences, they will receive recommendations that they can either add to their favorites or remove from recommendations.

## Favorited Activities Page

The Favorites Page displays activities that a user has liked. There, the user has the option to remove an activity they no longer want saved in their favorites.

If a user does not have any activities saved to their favorites list, an empty page displays specifying that the user doesn't have any favorites yet and a button to the survey for the user to find recommendations.

## Create an Activity Page

The Create an Activity Page allows users to create activities that can be published to the database. This allows the activity to be able to be recommended to all users of Adventurizr and saved to their (the creator or all other user's) favorites.

## User Activity Drafts Page

The User Activity Drafts Page is private to the user. It holds the activities the user has created before they are published to the database, turning into public recommendations for all authorized users. On the User Activity Drafts Page, the user is able to edit, publish, or delete their created activities.

can update their information as well as delete their account.
