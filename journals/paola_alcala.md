<!-- In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you'll need to include the following information in each entry:

The date of the entry

A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable

A reflection on any design conversations that you had

At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top. -->

Today I worked on:

* Creating a DELETE endpoint for removing an activity from the activities data table

Today I worked on:

* Creating a GET endpoint for getting filtered activities from a survey input

Today I worked on creating an endpoint that allows a user to fill out a survey that acts as a filter to grab a list of recommended activities.

While developing the GET endpoint for activity filtering, I realized that by using well-designed and efficient filtering logic, we could greatly enhance the user experience. This highlighted the importance of optimizing the query and data retrieval process, ensuring that our users receive timely and relevant recommendations.

Today I worked on:

* Creating a POST endpoint for creating an activity

Today, I took on the task of creating the POST endpoint for adding activities to our database. This endpoint will allow both administrators and regular users to populate our activities database. I defined two Pydantic models, one for ActivityOut and another for ActivityIn, to handle input and output data for the endpoint. I then implemented the ActivityRepository containing query functions for creating activities. I set up the API call in the routers, enabling users to send a POST request to create an activity in the data table.

During this process, I realized the importance of structuring the code for input and output data using Pydantic models. It makes the code more organized and helps prevent data-related errors, improving the overall quality of our project

Today I worked on:

* Setting up the activities SQL data table

Today I took on setting up the activities SQL data table. I did not run into any bugs. I created a new migrations file titled 003_activities_table.py. As a group we briefly discussed possibly hardcoding our data into the table but opted out and decided to populate our data table using an api POST request after deployment.

While working on this task, I realized that using an API POST request to populate the data after deployment would allow us to make dynamic updates to our activities database, providing us with greater flexibility and adaptability in the long run. Overall this shift from hardcoding to using an API POST request will save us a lot of time as a team.

Today, I worked on:

* Implementing the backend Authorization for the login, logout, sign-up endpoints using the JWTdown API library.

Emily and mob programmed the backend authorization. We decided to each tackle the auth on separate branches following Curtis' video on authorization and authentication using the JWTdown API library provided to us. During implementation, we encountered some challenges when applying hashed passwords, which led to some debugging and troubleshooting.

During the implementation of the authentication process, I realized the critical importance of securely handling user passwords. This experience reinforced the significance of data security in our project and the need for careful consideration of user data protection.

Today, I worked on:

* Creating issue tickets on the issues board and approving merge requests

Today our team focused on project management and code collaboration. I created issue tickets on our project's issues board, detailing specific tasks that need to be addressed. We also reviewed and approved several merge requests from team members. This collaborative effort ensures that code changes are thoroughly checked before being merged into the main branch, maintaining the code quality and consistency in our project.

During the merge request reviews, I realized the importance of communication and coordination among team members to ensure the smooth development of the project. Clear documentation in issue tickets and code comments makes the collaboration process much more efficient.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up the Adventurizr PostgreSQL Database with Emily.

Emily and I set up our project database following the instructions on learn. We added a volume for the PostgreSQL RDMS, psycopg to ./api/requirements.txt, PostgreSQL to the services section, a DATABASE_URL to the fastapi service to our docker-compose.yaml file. We ran the command docker volume create adventurizr to create our projects volume and then ran docker-compose up to create our updated containers.

Setting up our PostgreSQL helped me understand configuration a bit more in specific how the FastAPI service connects to the PostgreSQL database.
